## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a model from a pretrained VGG16 model to identify wildlife in Africa. Specifically, this is an object classification project aimed at classifying images of four animal species: buffalos, elephants, rhinos, and zebras.

This repository provides a detailed explanation of the different sections of our pipeline, displays metrics and results, and includes the testing evaluation of the model.
